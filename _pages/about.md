Hello! I am a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Computer Science, driven by a strong passion for technology and continuous learning. Throughout my academic journey, I developed a solid foundation in key areas such as software development, data analysis, machine learning, and systems design. I’ve always been fascinated by how technology shapes the world around us, and I’m committed to contributing meaningful solutions to real-world problems through code, data, and innovative thinking.

I thrive in environments that challenge me to grow — whether it's debugging complex systems, analyzing large datasets, or collaborating on cross-functional projects. I take pride in being a quick learner and a team player who is always eager to expand my skill set. Currently, I’m focused on building hands-on experience in industry through impactful work, while also exploring opportunities to deepen my expertise in areas like AI, cybersecurity, and scalable software architecture.

My goal is to continuously evolve as a computer scientist, work on projects that matter, and make a lasting impact through technology. I believe in staying curious, staying humble, and always pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve.
